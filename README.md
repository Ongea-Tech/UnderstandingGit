# About Me

Hi! I'm Edwin, a dedicated member of **Ongea Tech**, a vibrant community for learning how to code. As part of this supportive network, I am constantly honing my programming skills and collaborating with others who share a passion for technology and innovation.

I am particularly interested in **Software development, Programming, data science, and GIS e.g. web development, mobile app development, data analysis, machine learning, spatial analysis, geostatistics, remote sensing and cartography visualization**, and I enjoy exploring new tools and techniques to grow as a developer. Ongea Tech has provided me with the perfect platform to learn, share knowledge, and build projects that matter.

Excited to connect and grow together!
