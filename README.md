# About Me
Hi! I'm Faith Tum, a dedicated member of Ongea Tech, a vibrant community for learning how to code. As part of this supportive network, I am constantly honing my programming skills and collaborating with others who share a passion for technology and innovation.

I am particularly interested in Software Development, e.g., web development, mobile app development, and I enjoy exploring new tools and techniques to grow as a developer. Ongea Tech has provided me with the perfect platform to learn, share knowledge, and build projects that matter.

Excited to connect and grow together!
